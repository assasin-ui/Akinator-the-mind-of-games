# Akinator-the-mind-of-games
This C program implements an Akinator-style guessing game for Tollywood actors and actresses. The program builds and traverses a binary decision tree, where each node represents a question, and the answers (yes/no) determine the next step. The game continues until it reaches a leaf node, which contains the final guess .
